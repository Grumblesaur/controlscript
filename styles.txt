!! This is a comment. In a comment style sheet. How 'bout that.
!! Inline comments will cause linecount.py to blow chunks.
!! Empty lines are fine.
	!! Indented comments are fine.
!! If a language doesn't account for multi-line comments,
!! "````" is the preferred dummy delimiter, since it's probably never
!! going to be used. Any other sequence of characters that isn't going to
!! appear at the start of a source code file is also fine.
