100 :: DEPENDENCIES
  The commit.py, push.py, and pull.py scripts expect to be run in a git
  repository, and as such require git to be installed. Naturally, of course,
  you'll need to have Python installed as well, but if you hadn't figured
  that out already, I'd be curious as to why you're even still scrolling
  through this README.
